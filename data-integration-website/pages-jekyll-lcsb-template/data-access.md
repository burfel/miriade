Information on the datasets used will be provided here once the data has been shared within the consortium. 
At this point in time, we refer to the Data Management Plan (DMP) for future data sharing. 

Also, it will be possible to access most of the datasets; certain datasets will remain closed according to the principle "as open as possible, as closed as necessary".
