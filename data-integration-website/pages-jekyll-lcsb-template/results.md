# WP1: Biomarker identification

The goal of WP1 is to integrate existing â€“omics data for identification of pathways and candidate biomarkers for differential dementia diagnosis. For selection, we will perform data-integration of existing biomarker discovery datasets of available data sets generated in CSF, tissue or blood of dementia patients and controls. For each dementia type, the 3-5 most promising candidates will be prioritized for development in WP2 and WP3. A Dementia Disease Map will be developed to generate novel hypotheses of early-stage pathobiology of dementias.

## [Dementia Disease Map (DM)](http://miriade.lcsb.uni.lu/minerva/index.xhtml?id=bm_map-gpmlCellDesigner_SBML)

A comprehensive representation of disease mechanisms at the level of molecular processes will be developed, building a collection of interconnected signalling, metabolic and gene regulatory pathways relevant to dementia. The main steps are: 
i) using pathways from literature and reliable pathway databases with dementia customization; 
ii) develop consensus view by experts to ensure representation of disease hallmarks; 
iii) using inputs from text mining, protein-interactions databases and networks in BEL language to complete the reconstruction of mechanisms. 
The Dementia Disease Map will be developed in CellDesigner in the standard Systems Biology Graphical Notation using previously established protocols. 

Click [here](http://miriade.lcsb.uni.lu/minerva/index.xhtml?id=bm_map-gpmlCellDesigner_SBML) to access the current version of the Dementia Disease Map via the MINERVA platform for advanced navigation, zooming and visualisation.
This version is based on a first round of biomarker selection on an array-based proteomics dataset in CSF and subsequent discussions within the consortium. Based on this selection of biomarkers, we built a network accessing knowledge on the proteins and their interaction partners from various databases (e.g. Omnipath, STRING-db, Reactome) according to the three above-mentioned steps.
